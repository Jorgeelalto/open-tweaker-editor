# Open Tweaker Editor


This is an open source, multiplatform alternative to the official Electrix Tweaker MIDI controller editor. It allows you to set up the controller mapping, as well as configure some of the internal settings. It also has an easy to use preset system based on `.json` files.

It runs with Java, and it can be packaged with `jpackage` to be easily distributed and installed in Windows, macOS and Linux. More details in the technologies used are provided in the file `Memoria_TFG.pdf` (there's a short summary in English, page 130).

The application is **not finished**. It was made as a final project for my CS degree, and while it works fine and does most of the basic stuff you would wanna do regularly with mappings in the controller, it's unfinished and a lot of stuff is not implemented. If you wanna develop it further, you are welcome to do so (and please let me know!).
